# PowerShell Variable Interpolation Fix - Final Solution

## Issue
GitHub Actions was reporting PowerShell parser errors for complex variable interpolation syntax:
```
ParserError: Unexpected token '" + "' in expression or statement.
```

This occurred when using `$($_.Exception.Message)` in PowerShell scripts within YAML workflow files.

## Root Cause
GitHub Actions YAML parser has difficulty with complex PowerShell variable interpolation expressions, especially when they contain special characters like `$()` constructs.

## Final Solution
Replaced complex variable interpolation with separate Write-Host statements:

### ❌ Before (Problematic):
```powershell
Write-Host "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
```

### ✅ After (Fixed):
```powershell
Write-Host "Error details:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host $_.Exception.Message -ForegroundColor Red
```

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **YAML Compatible**: No complex interpolation syntax that confuses the YAML parser
2. **More Readable**: Clearer separation between static text and variable content
3. **Better Error Handling**: Each piece of information is displayed separately
4. **Consistent**: Same pattern across all workflow files

## Files Updated
- ✅ `power-platform-deployment.yml`
- ✅ `main-deployment.yml`
- ✅ `install-powerapps-modules.yml`
- ✅ `deploy-agent.yml`

## Testing Status
The workflows should now parse correctly without PowerShell syntax errors and execute properly in GitHub Actions environments.

## Additional Improvements Made
1. **NuGet Provider Fallback**: Added try-catch blocks around NuGet provider installation
2. **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed error messages with separate output lines
3. **CI/CD Resilience**: Multiple fallback methods for module installation
4. **Better Debugging**: Stack traces and detailed error information
