- Publish agent automatically          ← Not available in PP Build Tools
- Configure Teams channel             ← Not available in PP Build Tools  
- Configure Website channel           ← Not available in PP Build Tools
- Set up sharing permissions          ← Not available in PP Build Tools
- Validate agent functionality        ← Not available in PP Build Tools
```

**Power Platform Build Tools:**
```yaml
# Power Platform Build Tools - Manual Agent Steps Required
- Export solution with agent
- Import solution
- Manual: Go to Copilot Studio to publish    ← Manual step required
- Manual: Configure channels                  ← Manual step required
- Manual: Set up sharing                      ← Manual step required
```

### 2. **💰 Cost Efficiency**
- **This Solution**: Free GitHub Actions (2,000 minutes/month for free accounts)
- **Power Platform Build Tools**: Requires Azure DevOps (paid service for private repos)

### 5. **🛡️ Enhanced Environment Validation**
```powershell
# This Solution - Environment Checks
- Automatic DLP policy validation
- Environment type detection (Standard vs Managed)
- Service principal permission verification
- Agent compatibility checks
```

**Power Platform Build Tools:**
- Basic environment connection validation
- No specialized agent or DLP checks
