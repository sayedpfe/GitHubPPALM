## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start

1. **Clone/Fork** this repository
2. **Run setup script**: `.\scripts\test-setup.ps1`
3. **Create service principal**: `.\scripts\setup-service-principal.ps1`
4. **Configure GitHub secrets** (see [Setup Guide](./SETUP-GUIDE.md))
5. **Push to main** to trigger deployment

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… **Complete CI/CD Pipeline** for Power Platform solutions
- âœ… **Copilot Studio Agent Deployment** with channel configuration
- âœ… **Multi-Environment Support** (dev â†’ test â†’ production)
- âœ… **Service Principal Authentication** for secure automation
- âœ… **GitHub Actions & Azure DevOps** pipeline support
- âœ… **Local Development Tools** for testing and validation

## Overview

This solution uses GitHub Actions (or Azure DevOps) to automate the deployment of Power Platform solutions across environments using Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) best practices.

## Prerequisites

1. **Power Platform Environments**: Dev, Test (optional), and Production environments
   - âœ… **Standard Environments**: Full support with all features
   - âœ… **Managed Environments**: Full support with enhanced governance considerations
2. **Service Principal**: For authentication in the CI/CD pipeline
3. **GitHub Secrets** (or Azure DevOps Variables): For storing sensitive information
4. **Power Platform CLI**: Installed in the build agent
5. **Copilot Studio**: Enabled in your Power Platform environments

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Service Principal for Authentication

Run the following PowerShell commands to create a service principal:

```powershell
# Install required modules
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell -Force
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell -Force

# Create App Registration
$appRegistration = New-AzADApplication -DisplayName "PowerPlatform-DevOps-ServicePrincipal"

# Create Service Principal
$servicePrincipal = New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $appRegistration.AppId

# Note down these values for GitHub Secrets:
Write-Host "Application ID: $($appRegistration.AppId)"
Write-Host "Tenant ID: $((Get-AzContext).Tenant.Id)"
Write-Host "Service Principal Object ID: $($servicePrincipal.Id)"
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions):

- `POWER_PLATFORM_SP_APP_ID`: Application ID from step 1
- `POWER_PLATFORM_SP_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret for the service principal
- `POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID`: Your tenant ID
- `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_URL`: URL of your dev environment
- `PROD_ENVIRONMENT_URL`: URL of your production environment

### 3. Grant Permissions

The service principal needs appropriate permissions in your Power Platform environments:

1. Go to Power Platform Admin Center
2. Select your environments
3. Add the service principal as a System Administrator

## Workflow Structure

The GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. **Export Solution** from the dev environment
2. **Pack Solution** into a managed solution
3. **Import Solution** to the production environment
4. **Publish & Configure Agent** (if solution contains Copilot Studio agents)
5. **Configure Agent Channels** (Teams, Website, etc.)
6. **Run Tests** (if configured)
7. **Notify** on success/failure

## Agent-Specific Features

This deployment pipeline includes special handling for **Copilot Studio agents**:

### Automatic Agent Publishing
- Agents are automatically published after solution deployment
- Agents are enabled and made available to users
- Configuration validation ensures agents are working correctly

### Channel Configuration
- **Microsoft Teams**: Automatic integration setup
- **Website**: Embed code generation for web integration
- **Custom Channels**: Extensible for additional channels

### Sharing & Permissions
- Automatic sharing with specified groups or users
- Security configuration management
- Role-based access control setup

### Post-Deployment Agent Actions
The pipeline includes these agent-specific steps:
```yaml
# Automatic agent publishing and enablement
- Publish agent to production
- Enable agent for end users  
- Configure Teams integration
- Generate website embed code
- Set up sharing permissions
- Validate agent functionality
```

## Solution Management

- Solutions are exported as unmanaged from dev
- Solutions are imported as managed to production
- **Agents are automatically published and configured**
- Version numbers are automatically incremented
- Rollback capability through solution versioning

### Agent Configuration

When your solution contains Copilot Studio agents, the pipeline will:

1. **Publish the agent** - Make it available for use
2. **Enable the agent** - Activate it for end users
3. **Configure channels** - Set up Teams, Website, and other channels
4. **Set permissions** - Configure sharing with specified groups
5. **Validate deployment** - Ensure the agent is working correctly

### Environment Variables for Agents

Add these optional secrets for agent-specific configuration:

- `AGENT_NAME`: Specific agent name to configure (optional - configures all if not specified)
- `SHARE_WITH_GROUP`: Group to share the agent with (e.g., "All Company")
- `ENABLE_TEAMS_CHANNEL`: Set to "true" to configure Teams integration
- `ENABLE_WEBSITE_CHANNEL`: Set to "true" to generate website embed code
