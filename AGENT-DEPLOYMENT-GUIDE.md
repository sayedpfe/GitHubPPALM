# Agent Deployment Guide

## ðŸ¤– Copilot Studio Agent Deployment

This guide covers the automated deployment and configuration of Copilot Studio agents as part of your Power Platform solution.

## Overview

When your Power Platform solution contains Copilot Studio agents, the deployment pipeline automatically:

1. **Deploys the solution** containing your agent
2. **Publishes the agent** to make it available
3. **Enables the agent** for end users
4. **Configures channels** (Teams, Website, etc.)
5. **Sets up sharing** with specified groups/users
6. **Validates deployment** to ensure everything works

> ðŸ’¡ **Key Advantage**: Unlike Microsoft's Power Platform Build Tools, this solution provides **complete agent automation** - no manual steps required for agent publishing, channel configuration, or sharing setup.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Setup Requirements

#### **Both Standard & Managed Environments:**
- Power Platform environments (Dev, Test, Prod)
- Copilot Studio enabled in each environment
- Service principal with appropriate permissions
- Solution containing your Copilot Studio agent

#### **Additional Setup for Managed Environments:**
- Review and configure **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies**
- Ensure **required connectors are classified** appropriately:
  - Microsoft Teams connector (for Teams integration)
  - HTTP connector (for website integration)
  - Power Platform connector (for agent management)
- Configure **environment security groups** if using restricted sharing
- Set up **approval processes** if required by governance policies

### Required Secrets

Make sure these GitHub secrets are configured:

```
POWER_PLATFORM_SP_APP_ID
POWER_PLATFORM_SP_CLIENT_SECRET  
POWER_PLATFORM_TENANT_ID
DEV_ENVIRONMENT_URL
PROD_ENVIRONMENT_URL
```

### Optional Variables (for agent-specific features)

Set these as GitHub repository variables (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables tab):

```
AGENT_NAME=YourSpecificAgentName          # Optional: target specific agent
ENABLE_TEAMS_CHANNEL=true                 # Enable Teams integration
ENABLE_WEBSITE_CHANNEL=true               # Enable website embedding
SHARE_WITH_GROUP=All Company               # Group to share with
```

## ðŸ“‹ Agent Configuration Settings

Update `config/environment-settings.json` with your agent preferences:

```json
{
  "agentSettings": {
    "autoPublishAfterDeployment": true,
    "autoEnableAfterDeployment": true,
    "shareWithGroups": [
      "All Company",
      "IT Support Team"
    ],
    "agentNames": [
      "Customer Support Bot",
      "HR Assistant"
    ],
    "enableAnalytics": true,
    "configureChannels": [
      "Teams",
      "Website"
    ]
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ Manual Agent Operations

### Check Environment Compatibility

Before deploying, verify your environment is ready:

```powershell
.\scripts\check-environment-compatibility.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentUrl "https://yourprod.crm.dynamics.com" `
  -ClientId "your-app-id" `
  -ClientSecret "your-secret" `
  -TenantId "your-tenant"
```

This script will:
- âœ… Verify environment access and type (Standard vs Managed)
- âœ… Check service principal permissions
- âœ… Validate Copilot Studio availability
- âœ… Review DLP policies (for Managed Environments)
- âœ… Confirm required connectors are available

### Publish Agent Manually

```powershell
.\scripts\post-deploy-agent.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentUrl "https://yourprod.crm.dynamics.com" `
  -ClientId "your-app-id" `
  -ClientSecret "your-secret" `
  -TenantId "your-tenant" `
  -AgentName "Your Agent Name" `
  -PublishAgent $true `
  -EnableAgent $true
```

### Configure Channels Manually

```powershell
.\scripts\configure-agent-channels.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentUrl "https://yourprod.crm.dynamics.com" `
  -ClientId "your-app-id" `
  -ClientSecret "your-secret" `
  -TenantId "your-tenant" `
  -AgentName "Your Agent Name" `
  -EnableChannels @("Teams", "Website") `
  -ShareWithGroup "All Company"
```

## ðŸ“± Channel Integration

### Microsoft Teams Integration

When Teams channel is enabled, the pipeline will:
- Configure the agent for Teams
- Enable file uploads and markdown support
- Make the agent available in the Teams app store for your organization

**Manual Setup Required:**
1. Go to Teams Admin Center
2. Navigate to Teams apps > Manage apps
3. Find your agent and approve for organization use

### Website Integration

When Website channel is enabled, the pipeline will:
- Generate embed code for your website
- Configure welcome messages
- Enable file upload capabilities

**Embed Code Example:**
```html
<iframe src="https://web.powerva.microsoft.com/environments/YOUR_ENV/bots/YOUR_BOT/webchat"
        style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"></iframe>
```

## ðŸ”’ Security & Permissions

### Environment Types Support

This solution works with **both environment types**:

#### âœ… **Standard Environments**
- Full automation support
- All deployment features work
- Service principal authentication supported
- Agent publishing and channel configuration available

#### âœ… **Managed Environments** 
- Full automation support with enhanced security
- Additional governance features available
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies apply
- Enhanced monitoring and compliance

### Environment-Specific Considerations

#### For **Standard Environments:**
- Basic security model applies
- Service principal needs Environment Maker role
- Agents can be shared organization-wide by default

#### For **Managed Environments:**
- Enhanced security policies may restrict some operations
- **DLP policies** may affect agent channel configuration
- **Sharing restrictions** may apply based on governance settings
- **Additional approvals** may be required for agent publishing

### Service Principal Permissions

Your service principal needs these permissions:
- **Power Platform**: Environment Maker role (minimum)
- **Azure AD**: Application permissions for chatbot management
- **Copilot Studio**: Bot Framework permissions

#### Additional Permissions for Managed Environments:
- May require **System Administrator** role depending on DLP policies
- **Environment Admin** role for advanced governance features
- **Power Platform Administrator** role if environment has strict policies

### Agent Sharing

Agents can be shared with:
- **Specific users**: Individual email addresses
- **Security groups**: Azure AD security groups
- **Everyone**: All users in the organization

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Validation

### Post-Deployment Validation

The pipeline validates:
- âœ… Agent exists in target environment
- âœ… Agent is published successfully
- âœ… Agent is enabled for users
- âœ… Channels are configured correctly
- âœ… Sharing permissions are set

### Monitoring Agent Usage

After deployment, monitor your agent through:
- **Copilot Studio Analytics**: Built-in analytics dashboard
- **Power Platform Admin Center**: Environment-level monitoring
- **Teams Admin Center**: Teams-specific usage (if Teams enabled)

## ðŸ”„ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent Not Publishing:**
- Check service principal permissions
- Verify agent exists in solution
- Review deployment logs for errors
- **Managed Environments**: Check if DLP policies are blocking the operation

**Teams Integration Not Working:**
- Ensure Teams channel is enabled in configuration
- Check Teams admin center for approval status
- Verify service principal has Teams permissions
- **Managed Environments**: Verify DLP policies allow Teams connector

**Website Embed Not Working:**
- Check if website channel is configured
- Verify embed code is properly implemented
- Test in incognito/private browser mode
- **Managed Environments**: Check if external website connectors are allowed

**Permission Denied Errors:**
- **Standard Environments**: Ensure service principal has Environment Maker role
- **Managed Environments**: May need System Administrator role due to governance policies
- Check environment-specific security groups and access controls

### Environment-Specific Troubleshooting

#### **For Managed Environments:**
```powershell
# Check DLP policies that might affect deployment
Get-AdminDlpPolicy -EnvironmentName "your-environment-id"

# Verify service principal roles in managed environment
Get-AdminPowerAppRoleAssignment -EnvironmentName "your-environment-id" -PrincipalObjectId "service-principal-object-id"

# Check environment governance settings
Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName "your-environment-id" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Internal
```

#### **For Standard Environments:**
```powershell
# Standard permission check
Get-AdminPowerAppRoleAssignment -EnvironmentName "your-environment-id" -PrincipalObjectId "service-principal-object-id"
```

### Debug Commands

```powershell
# List all agents in environment
pac chatbot list

# Check agent status
pac chatbot show --name "Your Agent Name"

# Test agent connectivity
pac chatbot test --name "Your Agent Name"
```
