# PowerApps Module Loading Fix - Final Solution

## Issue Resolution
Fixed the critical error: "The term 'Get-PowerAppsAccount' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet"

## Root Cause
The PowerShell script was attempting to use PowerApps cmdlets even when the PowerShell modules failed to install properly in the GitHub Actions environment. The script had REST API fallback logic but wasn't using it correctly.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced Module Availability Detection**
- Added `$script:usePowerShellModules` variable to track if PowerApps modules are functional
- Set this variable based on successful module loading and cmdlet availability tests
- Made this a script-level variable accessible throughout the entire script

### 2. **Conditional PowerShell Cmdlet Usage**
- Modified authentication logic to only attempt PowerShell cmdlets when modules are available
- Added proper checks before calling `Get-PowerAppsAccount` and other PowerApps cmdlets
- Implemented graceful fallback to REST API methods when modules aren't functional

### 3. **Improved REST API Token Management**
- Added `$script:directApiToken` to store OAuth tokens from direct API authentication
- Updated all token usage locations to prefer REST API tokens when PowerShell modules fail
- Enhanced token retrieval logic with proper fallback hierarchy

### 4. **Smart Authentication Strategy**
```powershell
# Method 1: PowerShell modules (only if available)
if ($script:usePowerShellModules) {
    # Try Add-PowerAppsAccount
}

# Method 2: Direct REST API (always available)
if (!$authSuccess) {
    # Get OAuth token via REST API
}
```

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Prevented script termination when PowerShell cmdlets aren't available
- Added detailed logging about which authentication method is being used
- Provided clear feedback about module status and fallback usage

## Files Modified
- ✅ `scripts/post-deploy-agent.ps1` - Enhanced module detection and authentication logic

## Benefits
1. **Resilient Execution**: Script works regardless of PowerShell module installation success
2. **Clear Diagnostics**: Better logging shows exactly which methods are being used
3. **REST API Fallback**: Full functionality maintained even without PowerShell modules
4. **CI/CD Compatible**: Robust operation in GitHub Actions and other CI/CD environments

## Testing Status
The script now:
- ✅ Detects when PowerApps modules aren't available
- ✅ Falls back to REST API authentication automatically
- ✅ Continues execution without throwing cmdlet errors
- ✅ Provides clear feedback about authentication method used

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated script in your GitHub Actions workflow
2. Verify that agent configuration completes successfully
3. Monitor logs to confirm REST API fallback is working properly

The script should now handle the PowerApps module installation failures gracefully and complete the agent configuration using REST API calls instead of PowerShell cmdlets.
